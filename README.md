###### Extracurricular Counterfactual Renewable Assignment
This page hosts the "Extracurricular counterfactual" Renewable Assignment. that is connected to the research project on open co-curricular practices (OCP).

#### Overview

-This Assignment has two parts: the creation/product, and the comprehension questions.
-Implementation by the instructor follows 7 steps.
-Students complete the assignment by following 6 steps.

## Steps for the Instructor:
1. Show students the products/creations from previous classes and have them answer the comprehension questions
-First, you will engage your students with the previous students’ work. They will observe the creation/product and then answer the comprehension questions which apply theory to said creation. 
2. Decide on group vs. individual
-Second, you must decide on whether the assignment will be completed individually or in groups. This decision is based on your specific context, and account for factors such as course learning goals, class culture, course modality, and more. The decision can be made with the class, which is why it may help for them to have engaged with previous students’ work already. 
3. Explain assignment
-Third, you must explain the assignment. 
  -Start by introducing the concepts of counterfactuals and non-disposable (renewable) assignments. 
  -Then, you will introduce the creative task, which is the first half of the assignment; there are 3 options: comic strip, choose-your-own-adventure, and interview script. 
  -Next, you will explain the comprehension questions, which are the second half of the assignment that makes the explicit connections to theory. 
  -Then, you will explain the feedback process which can vary depending on whether they are in groups.
4. Release assignment
-Release the assignment for students to complete
5. Give Preliminary Feedback
-Peer feedback: Students will give each other feedback either individually or as a group (or if assignments are done in groups, peer feedback could be optional)
-Instructor feedback: Students will receive preliminary feedback from you to make improvements and a polished product
6. Mark Assignments
-Assign a grade, which can account for both before and after receiving the instructors feedback such that it reflects their initial effort as well as their effort in response to your feedback.
-You may also elect to mark students’ accuracy in completing the comprehension questions from previous students’ work, even if weighted less, to incentivize engagement and recall.
7. Store the assignments for a future class
-This is what makes it a renewable assignment! 
-This part may require connecting with departmental support staff if you are not guaranteed to be teaching the course again.


## Steps for Students:
1. Examine one of the products/creations from previous classes and answer the comprehension questions
2. Choose story and creative form.
3. Create the product
4. Create comprehension questions
5. Make adjustments based on feedback
6. Submit!

#### Introducing Counterfactuals and Renewable Assignments

What is a Counterfactual?
Counterfactuals refer to alternative timelines or alternate histories. For example, a famous counterfactual that serves as the basis for a television show is For All Mankind, which depicts an alternative world where the Soviet Union, not the United States, won the space race in the 1960s, sparking escalation, as opposed to de-escalation, of competition between countries and complexities of the Cold War. The single event has a cascading effect on how history would unfurl in this alternative universe. Aside from being an interesting basis for fictional work, counterfactuals also serve as an intellectual tool for scholars (Wenzlhuemer, 2009). To this extent, counterfactuals can also serve as a basis for educational activities, as is the case with this assignment.
